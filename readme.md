# Repository to do practice algorithms and problems

## Algorithms


Each algorithm will have its own folder.  The folder will contain:

- A excalidraw file with the algorithm and some explinations of how it should work
- A Python file with the algorithm
- A test file with the tests for the algorithm

## Problems

Each problem will have its own folder. These are common interview questions and leetcode problems.

The folder will contain:

- A excalidraw file with the problem and some explinations of how it should work
